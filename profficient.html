            <h2>Idea</h2>
            <p>I had an amazing opportunity with my project group to come up with our own project. 
                This project started at the beginning of the corona crisis. 
                We were brainstorming on new ideas and we came with the idea of a collaboration tool for small businesses. 
                The tool is based on communication. The main functionality is team chat. This idea was the most relevant and useful.
            </p>

        <div data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="400">
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>The first step was to determine our team roles. We were all Front-End Developers. But since I am also interested in the back-end, I formed with one other team member the back-end of this project. We were all involved with the design process. We did interviews to determine the first requirements, so we could start the sketching process.
                <br><br>
                After the Lo-Fi wireframes were finished, we created several mood boards and tested them in the field. The best mood board was converted into a style guide. With the style guide, we could transform the Lo-Fi wireframes into Hi-Fi wireframes. 
                <br><br>
                It was developing time! We used PHP as the back-end server-side language. Using PHP was fun and interesting but a bit hard, since it was my first time. We created a MySQL database for our login and chat-functionality. We got all the Front-End HTML pages from the others and converted them into PHP. After this, we had a working login/registration and a basic chat-functionality. Unfortunately, we couldn't make any more back-end functionality due to the time in the period.        </p>

            <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
            <p>I have learned a lot about how developing teams are working in the field. 
             <p> These are the skills that I have learned in this project:</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>- Agile Scrum</p>
            <p>- End-user interviews</p>
            <p>- Effective communication</p>
            <p>- User tests</p>
            <p>- Git/Github</p>
            <p>- Basic database knowledge</p>
            <p>- Basic PHP</p>
